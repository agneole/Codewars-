Who likes it? 

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. 
We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.
Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people 
who like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:
Kata.Likes(new string[0]) => "no one likes this"
Kata.Likes(new string[] {"Peter"}) => "Peter likes this"
Kata.Likes(new string[] {"Jacob", "Alex"}) => "Jacob and Alex like this"
Kata.Likes(new string[] {"Max", "John", "Mark"}) => "Max, John and Mark like this"
Kata.Likes(new string[] {"Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"}) => "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"

Build a pile of Cubes:

Your task is to construct a building which will be a pile of n cubes. The cube at the bottom will have a volume of n^3, 
the cube above will have volume of (n-1)^3 and so on until the top which will have a volume of 1^3.
You are given the total volume m of the building. Being given m can you find the number n of cubes you will have to build?
The parameter of the function findNb (find_nb, find-nb, findNb) will be an integer m and you have to return the 
integer n such as n^3 + (n-1)^3 + ... + 1^3 = m if such a n exists or -1 if there is no such n.
Examples:
findNb(1071225) --> 45
findNb(91716553919377) --> -1

Correct the time-string:

You have to create a method, that corrects a given time string. There was a problem in addition, 
so many of the time strings are broken. Time-Format is european. So from "00:00:00" to "23:59:59". 
Some examples:
"09:10:01" -> "09:10:01"
"11:70:10" -> "12:10:10"
"19:99:99" -> "20:40:39"
"24:01:01" -> "00:01:01"
If the input-string is null or empty return exactly this value! (empty string for C++)
If the time-string-format is invalid, return null. (empty string for C++)
Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

Break camelCase:

Complete the solution so that the function will break up camel casing, using a space between words.
Example
Kata.BreakCamelCase("camelCasing") => "camel Casing"

Summing a number's digits:

Write a function named sumDigits which takes a number as input and returns the sum of the absolute value of each 
of the number's decimal digits. For example:
  sumDigits(10);  // Returns 1
  sumDigits(99);  // Returns 18
  sumDigits(-32); // Returns 5
Let's assume that all numbers in the input will be integer values.
